"""What the Mirror answers when a client asks which server it is.

The login result carries the server's release (``AUTH_VERSION_NO``, the value a
client turns into ``connection.version``) and sqlplus prints a banner after
"Connected to:". Those were pinned to the captured XE 11.2 server, so a Mirror
advertising a 12c field version still introduced itself as 11.2.0.2.0. They now
follow the advertised field version instead.

**The packed release format**: ``major<<24 | minor<<20 | update<<12 | patch<<8 |
port``. Verified by decoding what three live servers send — XE 11.2 ->
11.2.0.2.0, XE 21c -> 21.0.48.0.0, 23ai -> 23.1.162.0.0.

``AUTH_VERSION_SQL`` is a small counter that moves with the release; the captured
anchors are 11.2 -> 22, 21c -> 25, 23ai -> 26. **12.2's value is not captured**
(there is no 12.2 testbed here), so 23 is taken from the gap between those
anchors. Nothing reads it back — a client decodes only ``AUTH_VERSION_NO`` into
its version property — so it is descriptive, not load-bearing.

The 21c and 23ai banners are what those two testbeds print after "Connected
to:" (``v$version``), measured 2026-09-06. The 23ai testbed is the 26ai Free
build of the 23 lineage, whose engine still reports the 23.1.162 release the
client decodes while its banner names the 23.26.2 build; both are kept as sent,
that mismatch being what the real server does.
