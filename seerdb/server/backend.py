"""The Backend contract — how the Mirror reaches an underlying database.

The Mirror speaks Oracle's wire protocol; a :class:`Backend` executes the SQL
behind it. One backend instance serves one client session. Concrete backends
(SQLite, PostgreSQL, …) live outside ``seerdb`` core, owning their driver
dependency; only this contract lives here.

Backends are **not** a least-common-denominator. Each declares its
:class:`Capability` set, and anything it cannot do is reported as a clean
``ORA-`` error (:class:`BackendError`) on a still-healthy connection — never a
desync. So SQLite legitimately refuses more than PostgreSQL, and that is
correct, not a failure.

    The wire carries no bind direction — Oracle infers IN / OUT / IN OUT from the
    block itself — so the Mirror can't label binds up front. Instead it passes
    *every* bind of a PL/SQL block as a ``BindVar`` (the input ``value`` seeded,
    ``None`` for a pure OUT) and the backend binds each as an OUT-capable variable
    of ``tns_type`` sized ``max_size``. After execution the backend returns each
    variable's value in :attr:`Result.out_binds`; the ones the block wrote are the
    OUT / IN OUT results, and the client keeps only the positions it bound as
    ``Var`` (see ``_assign_out_binds``). ``max_size`` is the OAC buffer length the
    client declared (e.g. 32767 for a VARCHAR OUT) — the fix for the
    ``ORA-06502: buffer too small`` a value-only bind hit.

    An ordinary statement's NULL bind arrives the same way: ``value`` None and
    ``tns_type`` the type the client declared for it (``setinputsizes``). A NULL
    says nothing about its type, and a backend that has to know — a CASE arm, a
    parameter it cannot otherwise infer — reads it from here (#699). Every other
    bind of such a statement is passed as its bare value.

    A PL/SQL associative-array bind (``cursor.arrayvar``, #122) has
    ``array_size`` set to the capacity the client declared and ``value`` a list
    of its elements (empty for a pure OUT); the backend registers an array
    variable of that capacity and returns the list it holds afterwards (#743).

    ``execute_many(sql, rows) -> int``
        Apply a whole array-DML batch in one call, returning the total
        affected-row count. Without it the session applies the rows one at a
        time.

    ``execute_many_rowcounts(sql, rows) -> tuple[int, list[int]]``
        The same, plus the per-iteration counts a 12c client can ask for.

    ``execute_returning(sql, rows) -> Result``
        Run a ``DML ... RETURNING col INTO :b`` statement and report what came
        back, in :attr:`Result.returned_rows` (#689). ``rows`` is one entry per
        execute iteration -- a plain execute has one, an array execute one per
        row submitted -- each holding the bind values in bind order with a
        :class:`BindVar` standing in at every position the RETURNING clause
        fills. Those carry no value from the client, and the BindVar says what
        type is wanted there. Without it such a statement is refused with an ORA
        error rather than breaking the connection.

        declares ``field_version`` makes the Mirror advertise it -- its identity
        (banner / release), the negotiated wire formats, and the auth parsers all
        follow it -- so the version is the backend's to choose, not the server's
        launch flag: the PostgreSQL / SQLite demos pin 11.2 (they cannot back the
        12c+ formats a higher version invites), while a passthrough presents the
        release its upstream speaks. ``tns_version`` overrides the framing version
        derived from it (needed only above 12.2, where the derivation caps).
        Absent (or ``None``), the Mirror uses the version it was launched with. A
