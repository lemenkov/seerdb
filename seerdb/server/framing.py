"""Server-side TNS packet framing.

This is the read/write counterpart of the client's ``Connection.recv()`` /
``Connection.send()``. Writing reuses :func:`seerdb.common.tns.encode_packet` verbatim
— the on-wire packet is identical whichever end emits it.

Reading, however, is *not* a straight reuse of :func:`seerdb.common.tns.assemble_packet`.
That routine reassembles multi-fragment ``DATA`` the way the **real Oracle
server** fragments it — keyed on an SDU-boundary heuristic
(``PacketSize == Length - 37`` / ``- 81``). A *client* fragments the other way:
``encode_packet`` splits at the full SDU and marks every non-final fragment with
the ``0x0020`` "more data" flag. Those two conventions are not inverses, so a
server that reused ``assemble_packet`` to read client requests would mis-split
any request large enough to fragment. We therefore parse the header ourselves
and key ``DATA`` reassembly on the ``0x0020`` flag — making ``read_packet`` a
true inverse of the client's ``send()``.

The 8-byte header has two layouts (see ``assemble_packet``): legacy
``len(ub2) + cksum(ub2) + type + flags + hdr-cksum(ub2)`` and, from protocol
version 315 (large SDU, #155), ``len(ub4) + type + flags + hdr-cksum(ub2)``.
