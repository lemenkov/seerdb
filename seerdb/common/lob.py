# Represents an Oracle LOB (CLOB / NCLOB / BLOB / BFILE) value returned by a
# SELECT. The raw locator the server emits in RXD is exactly what it expects
# back in a TTI_LOBOPS round-trip (verified by diffing against sqlplus's
# LOBOPS request locator), so we keep it verbatim and hand it back as the
# source pointer when reading.
#
# The locator's fixed metadata overhead is 102 bytes on Oracle 11g; for
# LOBs whose content fits inside the locator's inline budget the content
# is woven into the same block and we could pluck it out without a round-
# trip. We don't bother — going through TTI_LOBOPS works for inline and
# out-of-line content uniformly and is simpler.
#
# BFILE locators have a different layout (43+ bytes carrying the directory
# name and filename in plain ASCII) and require an explicit FILEOPEN before
# READ. We read them natively over TTI_LOBOPS — FILE_OPEN -> READ ->
# FILE_CLOSE (#46, OracleConnect.bfile_read_native) — using the open-flagged
# locator the server returns from FILE_OPEN.
