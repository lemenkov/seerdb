"""Reading the bind placeholders out of a statement's text.

Both ends of the connection need this, and they need to agree. The client scans
a statement to work out which value goes where, and how many to send. The Mirror
scans the same statement to work out how many values to expect, because a
`RETURNING ... INTO` bind is filled by the server and so carries no value in the
row data -- read one for it and everything after it is misread
(docs/PROTOCOL.md 22). One implementation, so the two cannot drift.

Nothing here touches the wire. It is text analysis, kept beside the codec rather
than inside it.
