"""Non-I/O cursor logic shared by the sync and async cursors (#553).

`Cursor` (sync) and `AsyncCursor` (async) duplicate a body of methods whose
logic contains no ``await`` and touches no socket — the DB-API accessor
properties, bind-variable / batch-error helpers, and the buffered (client-side)
scroll bookkeeping. `_CursorLogic` holds that shared logic; both concrete cursor
classes inherit it, so a single definition serves both and the sync/async parity
holds by construction. The genuinely I/O-bound methods (execute, fetch*, the
server-side scroll path, close, iteration) stay per-class.

The shared ``__init__`` establishes the cursor state the concrete I/O methods
read and write.
