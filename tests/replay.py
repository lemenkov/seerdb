"""Capture-replay test harness (#439).

A captured server response — pasted straight from ``hexdump -C`` / Wireshark /
tcpdump output — becomes bytes an offline test can push through seerdb's packet
framing and decoders, with no socket and no server: a fake transport seeded with
a captured byte buffer, as go-ora's debug session does it.

Capture files live in ``tests/captures/*.hexdump``. Each line is the canonical
``OFFSET  xx xx ..  |ascii|`` form; the offset column and the ``|ascii|`` gutter
are ignored, blank lines and ``#`` comments are skipped, so a capture pastes in
verbatim.
